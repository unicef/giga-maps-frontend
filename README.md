<h2><a id="about-giga" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#about-giga"><svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"></path></svg></a>About Giga</h2>

Giga is a UNICEF-ITU global initiative to connect every school to the Internet and every young person to information, opportunity, and choice. By connecting all schools to the Internet, we ensure that every child has a fair shot at success in an increasingly digital world.

About Giga Maps Frontend</h2>

Giga Maps Frontend is a live global open map of the internet connectivity of all the schools.

<h3><a id="why-it-is-important" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-it-is-important"><svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"></path></svg></a>
Why it is important? </h3>
<p></p>

Mapping schools is important because we can't solve a problem if we don't know the problem. Giga's mission is to connect every school to the internet and for that, we need to know accurate info on each school location, their connectivity and their infrastructure.

We need to put it on an open map because this is a global project with multiple stakeholders like governments, donors, investors, UNICEF implementation country offices, Internet service providers, partners, schools, open source community and of course, Giga. All of them need to have a common tool through which they can see the progress in connecting schools, highlight its importance and bring actionable clarity and transparency into the process. So, Giga Maps is this common narrative tool for all Giga members and stakeholders.

In the root directory of the application, you will find the configuration files for the development and build process. These include configuration files for code linting, the Jest configuration for the UI testing tool, and files for deployment with Docker. The source code is located in the src/ directory. The webpack/ directory contains the environment configuration and webpack configuration files.

Additionally, the jest.config.js file is used to configure Jest for UI testing. It specifies the test environment, the test files to be run, and the module name mapping.
