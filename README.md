## Technology Stack

GigaMaps is built using the following technologies:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types and other useful features.

- [Effector](https://effector.dev/): a library for managing application state in React applications.

- [Carbon UI library](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/): a UI component library that provides a set of reusable UI components for building web applications.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/): a tool for compiling modern JavaScript code to ensure compatibility with older browsers.

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): a module bundler that packages the code into a single file that can be run in the browser.

- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/): a preprocessor scripting language that adds special features to CSS.

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/): a library for styling components using JavaScript.

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in JavaScript code.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: contains the source code
  - `assets/`: static assets such as images, icons, etc.
  - `@/`:  directory with application custom components;
  - `api/` directory with all application endpoints and request functions, also contains a file with all responces types;  
  - `lib/` directory contains custom libraries implementations, helpers and utils;  
  - `core/` directory with application main elements;
  - `utils/`: utility functions
  - `App.tsx`: main app component
  - `index.tsx`: entry point

In the root directory of the application, you will find the configuration files for the development and build process. These include configuration files for code linting, the Jest configuration for the UI testing tool, and files for deployment with Docker. The source code is located in the `src/` directory. The `webpack/` directory contains the environment configuration and webpack configuration files. 

Additionally, the `jest.config.js` file is used to configure Jest for UI testing. It specifies the test environment, the test files to be run, and the module name mapping.
